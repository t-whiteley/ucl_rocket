TODO
* improve PID (include tuner?) and motor response
* change cd to Fd in equations via CFD and lookup table
* make atmos. density a function of height?
* make rocket mass a function of time?
* improve everything for noise robustness
    * filterring data 
    * improve conditions to start/stop for noise robustness
    * generate noise in data_generate()
* model isn't great when rocket reaches terminal v on way up?


PID notes
* too much initial overshoot stops rocket from reaching desired apogee
* interesting: oscillating 0.0001, 0.005, 0.00001, des=800


summary of algorithm thus far
* 4th order runge-kutta to estimate appogee
* error signal fed to PID
* PID feeds to step response of servo motor
