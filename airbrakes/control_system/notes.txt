Descrpiption of current implementation
1. filter noise using const a. kalman filter -> measure (h, a), estimate (h, v, a)
2. esimtate current apogee -> numerical differential eq solver (4th order runge-kutta)
3. control system -> difference in ap_pred and ap_des to a PID and servo signal
4. file descriptions
	* main.py is what gets executed, it is the airbrake control system loop running during flight and how the model should be run: "python3 main.py"
	* apogee.py estimates apogee given current conditions using runge-kutta
	* _model.py is a replacement for the sensor, it is a model that generates sensor data that feeds to:
	* _flightcomp.py is a replacement for the main flight computer, it takes care of sensor fusion and noise filterring to give valid data to main.py
	* _kf.py a basic constant acceleration kalman filter for a 1d model, to be replaced


TODO
2. improve from 1d to 3d model -> modules for sensor fusion - kalman??
3. improve kinematics of model by assuming rocket loses mass
4. make control system modelled to the dynamics of the system
5. optimise everywhere, CFD tables, lookup tables, algorithms

Notes on moving from 1d to 3d -> gyro
* sensor fusion algorithms: ahrs (for orientation): kalman/madgwick/complimentary
* euler angles, quaternions or DCM
* steps
	* find g vector using accel - (for initial configuration?) and assume vert at t=0
	* find quaternions and euler angles using madgwick from raw IMU
	* low pass before kf?
	* use baro + 6DOF IMU for a kalman filter

Q
* i might not need gyro, i can just calibrate and take the negative of the g vector
