Descrpiption
1. filter noise using kalman filter -> measure (h, a), estimate (h, v, a)
2. esimtate current apogee -> numerical differential eq solver (runge-kutta)
3. control system -> difference in ap_pred and ap_des to a PID and servo signal


Extra
* can use normal kalman filter with constant a model because near apogee its nearly constant
* extended kalman filter for non linear system can be used but is complex


TODO
2. improve from 1d to 3d model -> modules for sensor fusion
3. improve kinematics by assuming rocket loses mass
4. make control system more realistic -> modelled to the dynamics of the system (1 for liquid, 1 for FIRE)
5. Optimise everywhere, CFD table, lookup tables
