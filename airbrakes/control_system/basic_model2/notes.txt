Descrpiption
1. filter noise using kalman filter -> measure (h, a), estimate (h, v, a)
2. esimtate current apogee -> numerical differential eq solver (runge-kutta)
3. control system -> difference in ap_pred and ap_des to a PID and servo signal


Extra
* can use normal kalman filter with constant a model because near apogee its nearly constant
* extended kalman filter for non linear system can be used but is complex


TODO
1. make _apogee robust to noise
2. seperate into a model and main file
3. make constants capital named constants
4. make control system more realistic
5. make kalman filter account for rotation
6. CFD somewhere - lookup table?
