Descrpiption
1. filter noise using const a. kalman filter -> measure (h, a), estimate (h, v, a)
2. esimtate current apogee -> numerical differential eq solver (4th order runge-kutta)
3. control system -> difference in ap_pred and ap_des to a PID and servo signal


Extra
* can use normal kalman filter with constant a model because near apogee its nearly constant
* extended kalman filter for non linear system can be used but is complex


TODO
2. improve from 1d to 3d model -> modules for sensor fusion - kalman??
3. improve kinematics of model by assuming rocket loses mass
4. make control system modelled to the dynamics of the system
5. optimise everywhere, CFD tables, lookup tables, algorithms
