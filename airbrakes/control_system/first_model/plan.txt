control plan
* estimate current apogee via 4KF - higher order euler method to solve body diagram formula
* error signal (apo_cur - apo_des) fed to PID / D controller which feeds to servo motor
* servo???
* lookup tables???


control
* 4th-order Runge-Kutta method to constantly predict apogee and then drag from lookup table
* The look-up tables have been obtained through CFD models and FEA simulations that give us the corresponding drag coefficients and stress figures for various phases and angles of attack.
* Kalman filtering on the altitude/velocity/accel data


airbrake components
* MG996 high-torque servo motor
